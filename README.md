# Introduction 

Text summarization can be defined as the process of extracting important sentences a large document and combining them into a short version of the document.
Text summarization can be split into two types of summaries: extractive and abstractive :
abstractive => which ai system tries to write the summary of a given text just like a human would do " first read the input text and try to write a summary".
Extractive => where we try to learn the system that learns about important sentence in the input text and just extract them.
Try to achieve a model that make a text summarization as human .

Summarizing a text can be both time-efficient and cost-efficient.
Time-efficient => means the human reader can spend less time reading a document by reading a summarized version
Cost-efficient => means summarizing can be used for compressing the amount of textual data being transferred from a device to another device.






# Conclusion
* Proposed a summarization system that use different techniques to summarize news  + medical articles. 
* Used the summarized articles to do a classification job with different classification algorithms and compared its performance against the original articles. 
* The results shows high performance from the summarized articles with little difference against the original one, which proves that we can rely on them as a source of information.
